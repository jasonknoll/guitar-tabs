# Ascii Guitar Tabs
Repository to find scale and song tabs, completely free and open source.
*Remember: tabs are not perfect. When in doubt, trust your ear.*

## What can I find here?

I'm creating this repo to serve as a place for people to find guitar tabs written 
in Ascii form. There are websites like [Songsterr](http://songsterr.com/) that display tabs quite nicely,
however, I want to use Git and Ascii tabs specifically. 

## What is a tab? 

Tabs (or tablature) are pieces of written music that use a numbering system to represent
each note instead of a staff, like one might find on sheet music. Each number represents
the fret on the guitar that the player must play. `0` represents an open string while
`12` would be the 12th fret. 

Software like [Guitar Pro](https://www.guitar-pro.com/) is meant for composition and gives the 
users tons of bells and whistles to mess with. I will be using Ascii as it is much simpler and 
can be displayed wihtout too much issue here on Github. Sure, ascii lacks a lot of 
convienience features from GP or Songsterr, but these tabs can easily be transfered 
into either piece of software. 

### How to read Ascii Tabs

An Ascii tab typically looks like this:
```
e|------------------------| 
B|------------------------| 
G|------------------------| 
D|-------------------0--2-| 
A|----------0--2--3-------| 
E|-0--2--3----------------| 
```


The letters on the left represent the notes that the strings are tuned to (the tuning).
In this case, `EADGBe` represents E-standard tuning. The big `E` being the thickest string 
and the little `e` is the thinnest.

The above tab shows us how the `E minor scale` can be played from an open position. The player
will first hit their 0, 2 and 3 frets on the thickest string, then move down to the next string (the `A` string),
and play 0, 2, 3 again and so forth. 

**One thing to keep in mind** is that ascii tabs generally don't show the *rhythm* of the piece. They can, but most people
don't label them. You will have to listen to the music and discover the note lengths yourself. If the tab happens to be 
a musical-drill or scale (something that isn't a song), *most of the time* you can make up your own rhythms to aid your practice. 

## Are these tabs free?

YES. All tabs listed here are free to use or modify as you please. These are all created by passionate
players and listeners who want their favorite music transcribed.
